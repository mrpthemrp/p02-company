# never upload to repo from GitHub directly, that makes things kinda difficult :)

## GIT Guidelines!
1. ALWAYS pull when project opens up (to avoid merge conflicts)
2. commit every half an hour to keep track of your work
3. push your committed work before closing project
4. NEVER PUSH CODE THAT CAN BREAK THE PROJECT
5. Leave meaningful commit messages
